<h1>Jobb</h1>
===========

<h4>Hi there, welcome to the Jobb repository.</h4>
Jobb is a, right, job platform 'boilerplate' built with <a href="http://meteor.com">Meteor.</a> There was no intention to actually make a job marketplace and as you can see, it is not. ;) But feel free to clone it and make it your own. There's nothing much in this platform, but you surely can add 'things' to it.

You can try it out at <a href="http://jobb.meteor.com">jobb.meteor.com</a>


<h4>How to get started.</h4>

Pre-requisites: 

->You should have nodejs already installed on your computer.

->You can download it from <a href="http://nodejs.org">nodejs.org</a>




Once you've node installed, clone this repository to your desktop.

Next cd into the repo from your terminal and run meteor.
Like this:

<code>
    $ cd directory
    
    $ meteor
</code>
You'll find the app running at http://localhost:3000


Then? Just play around. Add your own code. Make it better. Pass it on. The choice is yours.
