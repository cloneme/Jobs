		<h2>Ola, welcome to Jobb.</h2>
		<p>Jobb is a lean job platform built with <a href="http://meteor.com">Meteor.</a><br>There was no intention to actually make a job marketplace and as you can see, it is not. <br> Feel free to clone it from <a href="https://github.com/cloneme/Jobs">Github</a> and make it your own. <br> There's nothing much than the basics, but you surely can add 'things' to it.</p>
