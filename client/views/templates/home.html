		<h1>Hi there, welcome to Jobb.</h1>
		<h4>Jobb is a job platform 'boilerplate' built with <a href="http://meteor.com">Meteor</a><br>There was no intention to actually make a job marketplace and as you can see, it is not. <br> But feel free to clone it from <a href="https://github.com/cloneme/Jobs">Github</a> and make it your own. <br> There's nothing much in this platform, but you surely can add 'things' to it.</h4>
